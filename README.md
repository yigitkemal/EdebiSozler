## General Info
In this project, I aimed to be able to share and store quotations easily over the phone. The application basically produces a jpeg output for us by combining images and quotes. These are jpeg images. allows us to manage inside and outside the app

## How to Use
When you enter the application, you will encounter direct quotes. In order to display these quotes in two different ways, I divided them into two different layers, and thus I got different views. You can add the quotes you like to your favourites, then you can perform similar actions in your favourites.

## Technologies
I developed an android application with Java. I keep the information of quotes on a host. I also did a simple backend coding with PHP to access here. I am pulling this data that I have kept from my host with a retrofit. The technologies I use are as follows;
*Java (In this project, android targetVersionsdk: 30 is used as minVersionSdk: 23.) 
*Retrofit
*Picasso
*Room
*RxJava
*PHP
